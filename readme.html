</p>
<p>Dataviz is a companion package for <a href="http://mutabit.com/grafoscopio/index.en.html">Grafoscopio</a> that puts together several examples of Domain Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Languages (DSV, DSL, respectively) developed with the <a href="http://agilevisualization.com/">Roassal agile visualization engine</a>. Included prototypes approach several themes like:<br />
Panama Papers as reproducible Research <span class="citation">[@luna-pp]</span>, Twitter Data Selfies <span class="citation">[@luna-tds]</span> and published medicine access <span class="citation">[@luna-infomed]</span> and are presented via blog post and internal interactive documentation via Grafoscopio notebooks. The classes in the package and their documentation show several levels of maturity from pretty mature (Panama Papers) to early coder practices (Infomed) and on going developments (Twitter Data Selfies) and are offered as examples and excersises to learners in our recurrent Dataviz workshop+hackathon, for code testing and refactoring.</p>
<p>It is suposed that you have familiarity with Grafoscopio and that you are in the same audience, as stated in its manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grafoscopio and its companion package, Dataviz, are intended to be used by learners and researchers in several fields: academia, journalism, activism, hacktivism and for anyone interested in open reproducible research and data storytelling backed by data and agile visualizations <span class="citation">[@bergel_agile_2016]</span>. This document assumes that you are such person.</p>

<p>Here are some other quick entry points for Dataviz:</p>

<li>The Dataviz paper for <a href="http://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS</a> will give you a quick scholar view for the software: abstract, metatada and links and to dig deeper: [<a href="./JOSS/paper.md">source</a>] | [<a href="./paper.tex">LaTeX</a>] | [<a href="./paper.pdf">PDF</a>].</li>

<h3 id="instalation-instructions">Instalation instructions</h3>
<p>Dataviz package is installed by default with the installation of Grafoscopio, but you can install it separately by using Monticello Pharo package manager configurations. To install and load Dataviz, simply run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><table class="sourceCode numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5

</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode">&quot;Start by loading the configuration of Dataviz&quot;
  Gofer new
    url: &#39;http://smalltalkhub.com/Offray/Dataviz/main&#39;;
    package: &#39;ConfigurationOfDataviz&#39;;
  load.

&quot;After that load Datavi&quot;
ConfigurationOfDataviz load.</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<h3 id="usage-instructions-examples">Usage instructions &amp; Examples</h3>
<p>As we said, Dataviz is a set of packaged exmaples of Domain Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Language (DSV and DSL) using Roassal agile visualization engine and/or documented with Grafoscopio notebook, so the usage instructions is related with how to use and explore such examples.</p>
<p>Dataviz presents a main notebook (from which this ̀readme ̀ file was generated), that introduce its Domain Specific Visualizations &amp; Languages. To open the notebook go to the Grafoscopio docking bar and select <code>Help &gt; Dataviz</code> or execute the following code:;</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><table class="sourceCode numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode">GrafoscopioDocumentation openDatavizIntro </code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<h3 id="api-documentation">API documentation</h3>
<p>Dataviz, like Grafoscopio, inhabits the Pharo full live coding environment, and we follow the custom of making the API documentation available inside a dynamic environment, instead in some static web page.</p>
<p>Instructions for opening different parts of the Dataviz API inside the system browser, and see the objects and messages organized by protocols, are provided in the companion interactive notebook, with other contextual information, so we recoment to refer to the notebook API documentation.</p>
<h3 id="community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</h3>
<p>Because the community that makes/uses Grafoscopio is the same for Dataviz, we follow the same community guidelines for contributing to the community, reporting bugs and other ways of collaboration. It is supposed that you are familiar with Grafoscopio and its manual, if you are using Dataviz. But, just for reference, plese see the Community Guidelines section in the <a href="http://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/grafoscopio/doc/tip/Docs/En/Books/Manual/manual.pdf">Grafoscopio manual</a> for more detailed information about the above subjects.</p>
