<h1 id="dataviz-readme">Dataviz readme</h1>
<p>Dataviz is a companion package for <a href="http://mutabit.com/grafoscopio/index.en.html">Grafoscopio</a> that puts together several examples of Domain Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Languages (DSV, DSL, respectively) developed with the <a href="http://agilevisualization.com/">Roassal agile visualization engine</a>. Included prototypes approach several themes like:<br />
Panama Papers as reproducible Research <span class="citation">[@luna-pp]</span>, Twitter Data Selfies <span class="citation">[@luna-tds]</span> and published medicine access <span class="citation">[@luna-infomed]</span> and are presented via blog post and internal interactive documentation via Grafoscopio notebooks. The classes in the package and their documentation show several levels of maturity from pretty mature (Panama Papers) to early coder practices (Infomed) and on going developments (Twitter Data Selfies) and are offered as examples and excersises to learners in our recurrent Dataviz workshop+hackathon, for code testing and refactoring.</p>
<p>It is suposed that you have familiarity with Grafoscopio and that you are in the same audience, as stated in its manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grafoscopio and its companion package, Dataviz, are intended to be used by learners and researchers in several fields: academia, journalism, activism, hacktivism and for anyone interested in open reproducible research and data storytelling backed by data and agile visualizations <span class="citation">[@bergel_agile_2016]</span>. This document assumes that you are such person.</p>

<h3 id="usage-instructions-examples">Usage instructions &amp; Examples</h3>
<p>As we said, Dataviz is a set of packaged exmaples of Domain Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Language (DSV and DSL) using Roassal agile visualization engine and/or documented with Grafoscopio notebook, so the usage instructions is related with how to use and explore such examples.</p>
<p>Dataviz presents a main notebook (from which this ̀readme ̀ file was generated), that introduce its Domain Specific Visualizations &amp; Languages. To open the notebook go to the Grafoscopio docking bar</p>
