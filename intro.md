# The Dataviz package

Dataviz, is a companion package for [Grafoscopio][grafoscopio-en] that puts together several examples of Domain
Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Languages (DSV, DSL, respectively) developed with the 
[Roassal agile visualization engine][roassal].
Included prototypes approach several themes like:  
Panama Papers as reproducible Research [@luna-pp], Twitter Data Selfies [@luna-tds]
and published medicine access [@luna-infomed] and are presented via blog post and internal 
interactive documentation via Grafoscopio notebooks.
The classes in the package and their documentation show several levels of maturity from pretty mature 
(Panama Papers) to early coder practices (Infomed) and on going developments (Twitter Data Selfies) and 
are offered as examples and excersises to learners in our recurrent Dataviz workshop+hackathon, for code 
testing and refactoring.

It is suposed that you have familiarity with Grafoscopio and that you are in the same audience, as stated
in its manual:

> Grafoscopio and its companion package, Dataviz, are intended to be used by learners and researchers 
in several fields: academia, journalism, activism, hacktivism and for anyone interested in open reproducible 
research and data storytelling backed by data and agile visualizations [@bergel_agile_2016].
This document assumes that you are such person.
