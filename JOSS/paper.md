  # Summary

  Dataviz is a companion package for Grafoscopio [ @luna-2014] that puts together several examples of Domain
  Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Languages (DSV, DSL, respectively) developed with the Roassal
  agile visualization engine [@bergel].
  Included prototypes approach several themes like:  
  Panama Papers as reproducible Research [@luna-pp], Twitter Data Selfies [@luna-tds]
  and published medicine access [@luna-infomed] and are presented via blog post and internal 
  interactive documentation via Grafoscopio notebooks.
  The classes in the package and their documentation show several levels of maturity from pretty mature 
  (Panama Papers) to early coder practices (Infomed) and are offered as examples and excersises to learners in our
  recurrent Dataviz workshop+hackathon, for code testing and refactoring.
