  # Summary

  Dataviz is a companion package for Grafoscopio [ @luna-grafoscopio-2014] that puts together several examples
  of Domain Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Languages (DSV, DSL, respectively) developed with the Roassal
  agile visualization engine [@bergel_agile_2016].
  Included prototypes approach several themes like:  
  Panama Papers as reproducible Research [@luna-panama-papers-2016], Twitter data selfies [@luna-twitter-ds-2016]
  and published medicine access [@luna-dsv-infomed-2016] and are presented via blog post and internal interactive
  documentation via Grafoscopio notebooks.
  The classes in the package and their documentation show several levels of maturity from pretty mature (Panama Papers)
  to early coder practices (Infomed) and are offered as examples and excersises to learners in our recurrent Data Week
  workshop+hackathon, for code testing and refactoring.
