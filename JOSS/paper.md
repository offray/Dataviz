  # Summary

  Dataviz is a companion package for Grafoscopio [ @luna_cardenas_metaforas_2014] that puts together several examples
  of Domain Specific Visualizations and Domain Specific Languages (DSV, DSL, respectively) developed with the Roassal
  agile visualization engine [@bergel_agile_2016] in the fields of data activism [@milan_medios_2015] and civic
  hacking [@schrock_civic_2016].
  Dataviz is the result of a PhD in Design & Creation, which is informed by the technique of observant participation
  [@moeran_participant_2007] and tries a critical approach to inhabit and foster communities and to provide them with some
  tools and prototypes for their usual endeavors.
  Included prototypes approach several themes like:
  Panama Papers as reproducible Research [@luna_cardenas_panama_2016], Twitter data selfies [@luna_cardenas_twitter_2016]
  and published medicine access [@luna_cardenas_domain_2016] and are presented via blog post and internal interactive
  documentation via Grafoscopio notebooks.
  Dataviz is part of a set of "pocket infrastructures", which are arrangements of tools characterized by being: simple,
  self contained, and working fine on-line and off-line and running in a wide spectrum of hardware, from USB drives to modest laptops
  and beyond (and in between).
  This contrast sharply with the exclusionary discourse, infrastructure and practice of "Big Data" and
  the classical idea of predicting the future by hyping only a part of it.
  Using such pocket infrastructures (like Dataviz, Grafoscopio and Fossil), researchers propose a way to put in
  "everybody's pockets" the tools for being a data/digital citizen, instead in only the places with "deep pockets"
  (money, resources, big data centers, gigantic data bases & data sets and so on).
  Some prototypes, like the one the Panama Papers, are showing that is possible to have a more inclusive approach,
  to problems that has been approached only from the Big Data perspective.
  This also means an alternative way of dealing with data.
  Instead of being the data threshing machine that tries to process everything, pocket infrastructures try to
  *build the magnet to find the needle in the haystack*, focusing on frictionless interconnected data
  [@pollock_frictionless_2013] and zooming out from there.
  The classes in the Dataviz package and their documentation show several levels of maturity from pretty mature (Panama Papers)
  to early coder practices (Infomed) and are offered as practical examples and excersises for data activist and related practitioners
  (in journalism, research a other fields) of how pocket infrastructures could be provided for such fields.
  Such examples, excersas used in our recurrent Data Week workshop+hackathon, for code testing and refactoring.
